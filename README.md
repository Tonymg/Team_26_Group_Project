Interactive Demo:

All of the classes are in a zip file title "FinalVersion_3.zip".  After downloading entire folder and compiling mainGame.java you should be good to go!  Run mainGame to play the game.  Welcome to our really awesome Tetris experience.  Running MySuite will run all of the test classes.  You will need to add the j-unit and hamcrest files to the folder before running MySuite because github got angry when we tried to include them.
