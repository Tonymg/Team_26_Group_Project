Demo 3:

All of the classes are in a zip file title "demo3REAL".  After downloading entire folder and compiling Tetris.java you should be good to go!  Welcome to our crappy Tetris experience.  Running MySuite will run all of the test classes.  You will need to add the j-unit and hamcrest files to the folder before running MySuite because github got angry when we tried to include them.
